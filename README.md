The project progressed smoothly from the start. Communication was effective through Discord messages and Teams meetings. The project tasks were distributed regularly, and during Teams meetings the group discussed together how to handle situations when someone faced an issue, for example during the testing phase.
######
The development remained strong until the end. Task distribution and any arising problems have been handled collaboratively, usually on weekends when work schedules have been less demanding.
